# Python Projects

This repository demonstrates my learning journey in Python, starting from simple projects and gradually moving to more refined and challenging ones. Each project helped me build new skills and deepen my understanding of programming concepts.

## 1. Password Generator
**Level:** Beginner

A simple command-line tool that generates secure passwords based on user preferences. The user can specify the length and whether to include uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. This project helped me learn about user input, string manipulation, and randomization in Python.

## 2. To-Do List Management
**Level:** Beginner/Intermediate

A basic to-do list management system with functions to create, view, mark as complete, and save tasks. This project introduced me to function organization, basic CRUD operations, and the importance of planning program structure for future expansion.

## 3. Trivia Game
**Level:** Intermediate

A command-line trivia game that randomly selects questions, collects user answers, checks correctness, and keeps score. This project improved my skills in working with dictionaries, random sampling, loops, and user interaction.

## 4. Youtube Video Manager
**Level:** Intermediate

A simple YouTube Video Manager CLI application using Python and SQLite to add, view, update, and delete YouTube video records locally.This project taught me about database management, CRUD operations, and how to structure a Python application for data persistence.
