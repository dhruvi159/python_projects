# Python Projects

This repository demonstrates my learning journey in Python, starting from simple projects and gradually moving to more refined and challenging ones. Each project helped me build new skills and deepen my understanding of programming concepts.

## 1. Password Generator
**Level:** Beginner

A simple command-line tool that generates secure passwords based on user preferences. The user can specify the length and whether to include uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. This project helped me learn about user input, string manipulation, and randomization in Python.

## 2. To-Do List Management
**Level:** Beginner/Intermediate

A basic to-do list management system with functions to create, view, mark as complete, and save tasks. This project introduced me to function organization, basic CRUD operations, and the importance of planning program structure for future expansion.

## 3. Trivia Game
**Level:** Intermediate

A command-line trivia game that randomly selects questions, collects user answers, checks correctness, and keeps score. This project improved my skills in working with dictionaries, random sampling, loops, and user interaction.

## 4. Finance Tracker
**Level:** (Planned/Work in Progress)

A more advanced project intended to track personal finances, manage expenses, and generate reports. This project will involve file handling, data persistence, and possibly data visualization, representing a step up in complexity and real-world application.
